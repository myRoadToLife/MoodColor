## 2. Core Features

### 2.1. Emotion Tracking

-   **Description:** Users can log their current emotions throughout the day. The core "emotions" are treated as resources that can be influenced by various in-app activities and events.
-   **Requirements:**
    -   [FE-1.1] An intuitive interface for selecting and rating the intensity of multiple emotions (e.g., Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Love, Disgust).
    -   [FE-1.2] The ability to add a short note to each emotion entry.
    -   [BE-1.1] Emotion data is saved securely and reliably to the backend (Firebase).
    -   [BE-1.2] Full offline support: emotion logging must work without an internet connection and sync automatically upon reconnection.

### 2.2. Emotion Visualization & Insights

-   **Description:** Users can view their emotional history through various visualizations to understand their patterns and triggers.
-   **Requirements:**
    -   [FE-2.1] A timeline view showing emotion entries over time.

    -   [FE-2.3] Charts and graphs showing the frequency and intensity of different emotions.
    -   [BE-2.1] The backend must provide efficient endpoints for querying emotional data for visualizations.

### 2.3. The "Jar" System

    -   [FE-3.2] The ability to "empty" or use the contents of a full jar for a rewarding in-app effect or insight.

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1. Architecture & Technology Stack

-   **Platform:** Unity Engine for cross-platform (iOS & Android) mobile development.
-   **Backend:** Firebase as a comprehensive backend-as-a-service (BaaS).
-   **Architecture:**
    -   **Modular & SOLID:** The codebase is structured into independent modules (Core, Gameplay, UI, Data) following SOLID principles.
    -   **Dependency Injection:** A DI container is used to manage dependencies and promote loose coupling.
    -   **Data-Oriented:** ScriptableObjects are used for configuration to separate data from logic.

### 3.2. Firebase Implementation

The Firebase integration is a critical component and must adhere to the following standards established during the "Firebase System Overhaul" (Story 001.001):

-   **TR-FB-1: Simplified Initialization:** Use the dedicated `FirebaseInitializer`.
-   **TR-FB-2: Full Offline Support:** All user-critical operations must be queued and handled by the `OfflineManager`.
-   **TR-FB-3: Centralized Error Handling:** All Firebase calls must be wrapped in the `FirebaseErrorHandler` for consistent retry logic.
-   **TR-FB-4: Performance Monitoring:** Key operations are tracked with the `FirebasePerformanceMonitor` to ensure performance targets are met.
-   **TR-FB-5: Atomic Operations:** Use `FirebaseBatchOperations` for any multi-write operations to ensure data consistency.
-   **TR-FB-6: Security:** Firebase Security Rules must be implemented to protect user data.

### 3.3. Performance

-   **App Launch Time:** The app must launch in under 3 seconds on a mid-range device.
-   **UI Responsiveness:** The UI must remain smooth (60 FPS) during all primary user interactions.
-   **Offline Operation:** The app must be fully functional offline, with a seamless sync process upon reconnection.
