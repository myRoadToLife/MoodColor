Readability the code should be understandable. Clear names of variables and methods, minimally necessary comments, uniform coding style.

Architecture we use SOLID, avoid God objects. Classes should have clear responsibilities, and we should follow design patterns.

Performance we monitor Update() calls, reduce the number of Instantiate() and Destroy(), use Object Pooling.

Structure we work with ScriptableObjects, separate logic and UI, use appropriate architectural patterns.


Automation where you can simplify your life  we simplify: Editor Scripts, automatic settings.
