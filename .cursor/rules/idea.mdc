I want to create an application on Unity for Android in which people will mark what they are feeling at the moment. Their emotions will be visually displayed in the form of jars with liquid and colored bubbles. The color and structure of the liquid will depend on the emotion. I will use Firebase to register and update the database in real time. Jars with emotions will stand on the windowsill and it will be visually visible how bubbles fly out of the jars and fly out the window. With the help of large bubbles, you can see which emotions prevail in the area and in the city. Small bubbles will “connect” into large ones. There will be statistics and a history of emotions. Also, as a motivation, every time the user marks his emotion, he receives game points. He can spend them on improving or decorating his jars. It will also be possible to change the visual of the place where the jars are. Initially, this will be a window through which it will be possible to see the weather and time of day. At the end of each day, all emotions will be saved for statistics. There will be various notifications. When there is a surge of emotions. Or when the jars are filled. Ability to add users as friends and track their activity. Reminders to log in to the app, etc. Advertising service and the ability to turn off advertising for a subscription and buy in-game currency.
